# Tic Tac Toe 2.0

We want to bring the pen-and-paper game Tic-tac-toe to the digital age,
but with a little twist: the size of the playfield should be
configurable between 3x3 and 10x10. And we also want the symbols
(usually O and X) to be configurable. Also it should be for 3 players
instead of just 2.

This program created based on [Metronom](https://www.metronom.com/) home assignment task for hiring process.
